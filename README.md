#Scalable Microservices with FastAPI, React, and Redis Streams
This project demonstrates a scalable microservices architecture featuring FastAPI for the backend services, React for the frontend, and Redis as the primary data store and communication backbone using Redis Streams. It showcases two core services: Inventory Management and Order Processing, designed to communicate asynchronously and efficiently.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
This mini-project aims to illustrate the principles of building robust and scalable microservices. By separating concerns into distinct services and leveraging Redis Streams for inter-service communication, the application achieves high availability, fault tolerance, and ease of scaling. The React frontend provides an intuitive user interface to interact with these services.

âœ¨ Features
Inventory Management Service: Manages product stock, updates quantities, and processes inventory-related requests.

Order Processing Service: Handles customer orders, validates stock availability, and processes order fulfillment.

Redis as Database: Utilizes Redis for fast data storage and retrieval.

Redis Streams for Communication: Enables asynchronous, reliable, and ordered communication between microservices.

FastAPI Backend: High-performance, easy-to-use web framework for building APIs.

React Frontend: Modern, component-based UI for a dynamic user experience.

Scalable Architecture: Designed for horizontal scaling of individual services.
